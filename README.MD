# Project Overview : 
This project is my own implementation of a robust end-to-end ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline designed to efficiently process large volumes of daily sales data batches generated by multiple retail servers. These batches arrive in various raw formats such as JSON, text, and CSV. The primary goal of this pipeline is to automate the ingestion and transformation of disparate raw data into consistent, clean, and business-ready data models and data marts that can be immediately used for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) or for further data science workloads.
